            <p class="mar-bottom post">I've had a personal goals list, or bucket list, on my phone for a while now. But like a lot of ideas and other things, they get buried and forgotten, at least for a period of time. Thus, I have created my own <strong>Impossible List</strong>. The idea comes from Joel Runyon, who <a href="http://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/">originally created the impossible list.</a> It is meant to serve as an ever-changing, ever-evolving list of "impossible" goals and experiences that challenge you as an individual to go above and beyond what you originally thought possible. By sharing my impossible list, I hope it serves as a constant reminder to myself to achieve these items and I promise to keep it updated on my journey.</p>
