Sam was great team member that we were able to count on for any tasks. I truly appreciate Sam for his sharp development skills and being a great team player. Sam is an asset to any team and I look forward to working with Sam in the future.'

    'rec': 'I had the opportunity to work closely with Sam on a large, complex, system integration and software development project for a very demanding client. I cannot overstate how critical Sam was to the success of the project. He is one of those rare resources that can take a vague task and independently turn it into an outstanding solution that will delight your clients.<br/><br/>Sam is the person employers have in mind when they say their top performers are 10 times more productive than their counterparts. He not only is a great asset himself, but works in a collaborative, supportive manor that elevates his entire team. '
