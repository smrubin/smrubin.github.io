    'description': 'A U.S. Government Federal Agency was deploying a financial application suite that encompassed several disparate box product systems. The agency desired a web application landing page and portal that provided a single point of entry into all of these systems. The application needed to be very intuitive and, in real-time, query and present data from the other system APIs. Finally, the client stakeholders required a consistent look, feel, and integration across the applications to make a seamless experience for the users. This integration proved especially challenging with the difficulties surrounding cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).',

Before the launch of their new website, virtually no web presence existed for the practice or any of the three doctors, who are leaders in their industry.

    'description': 'Our team of two wanted to embrace the full process of designing and developing a game. For an agile workflow, we set up Trello to bucket our tasks, assign them, and track their completion. Then we white-boarded responsive designs for the game and solicited feedback from potential players, made some changes, and repeated this process. Finally, we dove into the code and created a responsive game built with draggable HTML5 canvas components, maintaining and versioning our code over Git.',
