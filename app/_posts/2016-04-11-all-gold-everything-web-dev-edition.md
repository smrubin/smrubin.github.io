Working in a team environment, I constantly find myself projecting my desktop to others in the room. And every time I do, I get asked about several of the *cool* looking applications in my taskbar / dock. Specifically, everyone wants to know how and where I got the Golden Google Chrome icon.

Surprising to most, the gold Chrome icon actually is packaged with your Google Chrome download (i.e. it's already on your computer). This post will walk through how you can get the Gold Chrome icon, impress all your friends, and be a little more like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/trinidad-jame/all-gold-everything" target="_blank">Trinidad James</a>...if that's your thing.

<h3 id="windows">Windows Users</h3>

1. If you haven't already, download <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>.

2. Right-click on your desktop and select `New --> Shortcut`. In the pop-up, navigate to your chrome.exe file. This should be located in your `Program Files` in a path similar to: `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application`  
  When you've found it, select it, hit Next, and then Finish. There should now be a traditional Google Chrome shortcut on your desktop.  

3. Right-click on your newly created shortcut and select `Properties`. Under the `Shortcut` tab, select the `Change Icon...` button. You should be now see the Gold Chrome icon that you can select and make active.  
  If you don't see icons to choose from, you will need to specify the file path. This path should be the same path as that from Step 2. It should be similar to: `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`.

4. Finally, unpin your current Chrome application from your Taskbar. Right-click on your new Gold Chrome application, and select `Pin to Taskbar`.

5. Congratulations, you can now get back to browsing with the Golden Google Chrome.


<h3 id="mac">Mac Users</h3>

1. If you haven't already, download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/).

2. Now, unfortunately for Mac Users, the Gold Chrome icon doesn't actually come pre-packaged with the standard Google Chrome download for Mac. But no worries, you can just save the image below to your desktop and use that. Either drag or right-click and save the image below to your desktop.

3. Next, create a shortcut for your Google Chrome application, located in your Applications folder, by either dragging a copy to the desktop or right-clicking and selecting `Make Alias`.

4. Select and right-click your new shortcut / alias for Google Chrome, and select `Get Info`. In the top-right of the pop-up menu, you will see the current icon used for your Google Chrome alias. Drag and drop the Golden Google Chrome icon, downloaded from the image above, onto the existing icon. It should now replace the standard Chrome icon.

5. Feel free to either leave the alias on your desktop, or drag it to your Dock. Congratulations, you can now get back to browsing with the Golden Google Chrome.


### So where does this Gold Chrome icon really come from?

Google Chrome offers a variation of their browser, called Chrome Canary, which has the newest of the new Chrome features. It is designed for developers and early adopters. The icon for Chrome Canary is the golden Chrome icon and Google packages all of the icons together. This way, even though you downloaded the standard Google Chrome, you still have access to the Chrome Canary icon set!
