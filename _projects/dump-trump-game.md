description: What happens when you spend a weekend with a friend learning and hacking together a small project? This. A fun and addicting parody puzzle game. Serving as the lead developer, I used open-source resources to construct a mobile-friendly game that renders images and shapes on an HTML5 Canvas element and allows the user to interact with the canvas with both touch and click events. Check out how our team hacked this project together in under a week.

<h2 class="article-title">Process</h2>
Our team of two wanted to embrace the full process of designing and developing a game. For an agile workflow, we set up Trello to bucket our tasks, assign them, and track their completion. Then we white-boarded responsive designs for the game and solicited feedback from potential players, made some changes, and repeated this process. Finally, we dove into the code and created a responsive game built with draggable HTML5 canvas components, maintaining and versioning our code over Git. [Check it out here!](http://dumptrumpgame.com)

<h2>Results</h2>
After launching the game and sharing it across social media, we received a lot of great feedback. The game has accumulated over 1,000 unique plays and still generates unique visits even after more than a month since the release. Many users have provided amazing feedback that we hope to incorporate into a future release.
