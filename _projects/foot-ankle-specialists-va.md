<h2 class="article-title">Challenges</h2>
Foot and Ankle Specialists of Virginia (FASV), a podiatry practice located in Richmond, VA, was seeking to launch a website for the first time for their practice. Before the launch of their new website, virtually no web presence existed for the practice or any of the three doctors, who are leaders in their industry. The practice was seeking a website to increase online presence and foot traffic and the inclusion of an online appointment request form to help reduce burden of phone calls for the front office staff.

<h2>Results</h2>
The launch and integration of the practice website and new business-technology practices were a great success. The website quickly jumped to the front of search engines for keywords that FASV was interested in. In its first year of launching, it has resulted in over a thousand page views and resulted in over 100 new patients completing an online appointment request form and making an appointment with the practice- creating a direct and measurable impact for the doctors. Furthermore, the front office staff now has a reduced burden of answering phone calls, due to the increased digital contact of potential patients.
