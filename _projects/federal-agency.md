intro: A U.S. Government Federal Agency was in need of a landing page and portal to bring together disparate systems. They required a solution that was sleek and consistent across all systems, and that integrated all user actions into a single, manageable landing page. Check out how my solution brought together these different systems under one roof and created a modern and intuitive, front-facing application for agency stakeholders.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
A U.S. Government Federal Agency was deploying a financial application suite that encompassed several disparate box product systems. The agency desired a landing page and portal that provided a single point of entry into all of these systems. The landing page needed to be very intuitive and, in real-time, query and present data from the other systems' APIs. Finally, the client stakeholders required a consistent look, feel, and integration across the applications to make a seamless experience for the users. This integration proved especially challenging with the difficulties surrounding cross-origin resource sharing.

<h2>Results</h2>
The Federal Agency's application suite is currently gearing up for their first major release. The landing page and portal serve as an integral part of the first release and have received commendation from both the internal team and client stakeholders. The clients are eager to upgrade from a legacy system to one with a sleak user interface and ease of use. All of the live demoes have beeen successful and exceeded expectations to date. Be on the lookout for final results from the application's first and continued releases.
