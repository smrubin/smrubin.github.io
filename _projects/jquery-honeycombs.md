How do you create a responsive grid of hexagons to form a honeycomb shape? How do you account for different hexagon orientations (vertical and horizontal)? How do the layouts and responsiveness of the grid change with these different orientations? All of these questions had to be answered with logic, mathematics, and responsive web design to arrive at a re-usable and easily implementable jQuery plugin.
